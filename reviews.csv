June 27,Real_CryptoRoy,"Usually I agree with your analysis but can't agree on this one. 54% correction? It's kinda too much at this point. Maybe in 2026 yes but not now. Moreover, after the halving BTC price dropping below 40k is basically impossible due to the cost of mining. Throughout of the history of Bitcoin this was one of the most reliable indicator to understand possible lowest price. If I'm not mistaken at the moment cost of mining of 1 Bitcoin seats at around 45k-50k, so I don't think that price can drop below that level."
June 28,madoperator,"your point is well taken but: 1. NOTHING is ""basically impossible"" in any market no matter how much capital is locked in red. 2. At the same time, technicals mean nothing to the consumers buying and selling but are latent numerical phenomena. What I mean is consumers en masse are motivated by other factors. 3. People are a little too comfortable at this price point in my humble opinion, which can easily be shaken. 4. I think it is wise to look for indirect evidence in other markets like stocks and treasuries and dollar index. 5. The ascending triangle is a continuation pattern. 6. CryptoRoy, miners don't buy but they do sell equipment, the reason is because HODLers are also ready at the defense at those levels. HODLers aren't traditional market participants, we had BTC when it was $100, we will hold it all at 0 and give just as many fks. Why? Because we prefer it over holding the dollar."
July 7,woutergelaude2,"I think xanrox concluded a while ago that according to his analysis and not changing market conditions the price would rise untill 100K. That analysis is still correct and I believe 100k will be reached but on the way towards it, we will face some bear markets caused by changing circumstances which xanrox could not take in account for his analysis. For example: war, some idiot like Powell that said something stupid or negative, acceptance of the new European crypto low (which forbids stablecoins for the most part such as usdt. Csdc is allowed and acknowledged. But many others are not. This will olso have some influence. So I can find Me in xanrox analysis that at this moment cards changed and we will go bearish for a while untill market is stabilised and ready to rise again. And then I can follow xanrox that a price of 100K is possible. Besides, what are the chances companies Like Blackrock would set up and invest in their own bitcoin ETF without the certainty that they will earn 10x more on it? I guess small. No?"
June 27,SpartaBTC,In my opinion this is a very apocalyptic scenario. I think that this zone will be held and the double top figure will not be realized.
June 30,sdraxer,"I respect your opinion and I wish that you don't get out of market because things gonna shake up. It's crypto summer and crypto no longer work with the charts anymore becuase, before people were reading charts and act like it. but now it depend on the news and we have a big big news comming the most exciting one is trump will be president then all the rest is history."
July 1,MyCryptoParadise_Jack,"From mine personal point of view as a trader from the ParadiseTeam, it's always intriguing to see such bold predictions. While a 54% crash would indeed be dramatic, we must consider the broader market conditions and historical precedents. Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and volatility, which often leads to surprising rebounds."
June 29,Rzgar_,I hope you are prepared for what is coming. I foresee a significant crash in altcoins (50% - 80% decline) ahead.
July 1,ehsansoleimanian,"Bitcoin is an uptrend technology and does not care about Technical analysis . It does not mean that bullran is over or not , the only things that I'm sure is Bitcoin will continue and feeds its children for a long times. We are not talking about a shitty market , we are talking about the complicated technnlogy which is based on Blockchain ,54% crash will make all dead . it's a crazy opinion ,so don't share it and don't be sharp"
June 30,Iorgtorg,"In the end doesn't mather if goes down or up, sideways, diagonal, whatever. For the average normal non-trading millions of people in this planet that are stacking sats the most important thing to look after is the 99,99% certain Bitcoin Power Law Chart. That's it. It doesn't mather. If goes down to 50k, perfect for us, we buy more or if it goes that low i think there will be no bitcoin more to buy. They're gone, all the saylors, Finks, Dells, etc etc will buy everything. Will be no BTC left for us. Good job Xarox. We love you."
June 30,Vibrentz,"Hey man, you guys really believe that btc is going to go below 30k? What’s your catalyst? I’ve read through your description but you’ve failed to actually add any catalysts e.g. Events that will bring it lower, what happens if we get that so called “rate cut” next month? Or 2 months? Or the ETH etf release? Also the massive ETFs that have come into play with btc. Reading numbers is easy, but this kind of prediction is absurd. We have not come out of the bull run, just because you made some profits off a few shorts doesn’t mean we are going to see a 54% decrease! Stop basing your predictions off a Fibonacci “retracement” level. We all know the epic forces of dark and light that have come into play with crypto, maybe outside of a bull run the Fibonacci level will be applicable but not right now. Don’t let people persuade you otherwise, I’m fully bullish on btc, maybe as of right now we are seeing some weakness and that’s due to the German government selling, ETFs selling, and for some added manipulation mt.Gox. Watch all this add a lot of fud to the market next month, could possibly see a drop to 55k but I highly doubt a drop below 50k is imminent. EVERYONE will start to fomo back in, including the ETFs and public then we will see ATH’s again in about 2 months (rough estimate) but stay strong guys and I would like some of what you’re smoking"
July 6,Khosroparviz,"Your analysis is excellent, and I always follow you. But the interesting thing is that we have a strong cloud support at 42000 based on Residual Ichimoku Cloud method in the daily time frame, which will definitely turn into the strongest uptrend support after hitting it, which is around $71,000. Secondly, the weekly trend line passes around 42000, and it seems to me that this point will be the best point for a reversal, almost around the 50% Fibonacci level and not 61.8, which can be considered as a reversal point right from there. Of course, I have benefited from the Residual Ichimoku Cloud method from weekly to 15min timeframes and seen its accuracy. But I don't know how accurate your Elliott Wave analysis compares to my method, which your method is likely more engineering-oriented. Goodluck."
