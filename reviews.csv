27-Jun,Real_CryptoRoy,"Usually I agree with your analysis but can't agree on this one. 54% correction? It's kinda too much at this point. Maybe in 2026 yes but not now. Moreover, after the halving BTC price dropping below 40k is basically impossible due to the cost of mining. Throughout of the history of Bitcoin this was one of the most reliable indicator to understand possible lowest price. If I'm not mistaken at the moment cost of mining of 1 Bitcoin seats at around 45k-50k, so I don't think that price can drop below that level."
28-Jun,madoperator,"your point is well taken but: 1. NOTHING is ""basically impossible"" in any market no matter how much capital is locked in red. 2. At the same time, technicals mean nothing to the consumers buying and selling but are latent numerical phenomena. What I mean is consumers en masse are motivated by other factors. 3. People are a little too comfortable at this price point in my humble opinion, which can easily be shaken. 4. I think it is wise to look for indirect evidence in other markets like stocks and treasuries and dollar index. 5. The ascending triangle is a continuation pattern. 6. CryptoRoy, miners don't buy but they do sell equipment, the reason is because HODLers are also ready at the defense at those levels. HODLers aren't traditional market participants, we had BTC when it was $100, we will hold it all at 0 and give just as many fks. Why? Because we prefer it over holding the dollar."
7-Jul,woutergelaude2,"I think xanrox concluded a while ago that according to his analysis and not changing market conditions the price would rise untill 100K. That analysis is still correct and I believe 100k will be reached but on the way towards it, we will face some bear markets caused by changing circumstances which xanrox could not take in account for his analysis. For example: war, some idiot like Powell that said something stupid or negative, acceptance of the new European crypto low (which forbids stablecoins for the most part such as usdt. Csdc is allowed and acknowledged. But many others are not. This will olso have some influence. So I can find Me in xanrox analysis that at this moment cards changed and we will go bearish for a while untill market is stabilised and ready to rise again. And then I can follow xanrox that a price of 100K is possible. Besides, what are the chances companies Like Blackrock would set up and invest in their own bitcoin ETF without the certainty that they will earn 10x more on it? I guess small. No?"
27-Jun,SpartaBTC,In my opinion this is a very apocalyptic scenario. I think that this zone will be held and the double top figure will not be realized.
30-Jun,sdraxer,"I respect your opinion and I wish that you don't get out of market because things gonna shake up. It's crypto summer and crypto no longer work with the charts anymore becuase, before people were reading charts and act like it. but now it depend on the news and we have a big big news comming the most exciting one is trump will be president then all the rest is history."
1-Jul,MyCryptoParadise_Jack,"From mine personal point of view as a trader from the ParadiseTeam, it's always intriguing to see such bold predictions. While a 54% crash would indeed be dramatic, we must consider the broader market conditions and historical precedents. Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and volatility, which often leads to surprising rebounds."
29-Jun,Rzgar_,I hope you are prepared for what is coming. I foresee a significant crash in altcoins (50% - 80% decline) ahead.
1-Jul,ehsansoleimanian,"Bitcoin is an uptrend technology and does not care about Technical analysis . It does not mean that bullran is over or not , the only things that I'm sure is Bitcoin will continue and feeds its children for a long times. We are not talking about a shitty market , we are talking about the complicated technnlogy which is based on Blockchain ,54% crash will make all dead . it's a crazy opinion ,so don't share it and don't be sharp"
30-Jun,Iorgtorg,"In the end doesn't mather if goes down or up, sideways, diagonal, whatever. For the average normal non-trading millions of people in this planet that are stacking sats the most important thing to look after is the 99,99% certain Bitcoin Power Law Chart. That's it. It doesn't mather. If goes down to 50k, perfect for us, we buy more or if it goes that low i think there will be no bitcoin more to buy. They're gone, all the saylors, Finks, Dells, etc etc will buy everything. Will be no BTC left for us. Good job Xarox. We love you."
30-Jun,Vibrentz,"Hey man, you guys really believe that btc is going to go below 30k? What‚Äôs your catalyst? I‚Äôve read through your description but you‚Äôve failed to actually add any catalysts e.g. Events that will bring it lower, what happens if we get that so called ‚Äúrate cut‚Äù next month? Or 2 months? Or the ETH etf release? Also the massive ETFs that have come into play with btc. Reading numbers is easy, but this kind of prediction is absurd. We have not come out of the bull run, just because you made some profits off a few shorts doesn‚Äôt mean we are going to see a 54% decrease! Stop basing your predictions off a Fibonacci ‚Äúretracement‚Äù level. We all know the epic forces of dark and light that have come into play with crypto, maybe outside of a bull run the Fibonacci level will be applicable but not right now. Don‚Äôt let people persuade you otherwise, I‚Äôm fully bullish on btc, maybe as of right now we are seeing some weakness and that‚Äôs due to the German government selling, ETFs selling, and for some added manipulation mt.Gox. Watch all this add a lot of fud to the market next month, could possibly see a drop to 55k but I highly doubt a drop below 50k is imminent. EVERYONE will start to fomo back in, including the ETFs and public then we will see ATH‚Äôs again in about 2 months (rough estimate) but stay strong guys and I would like some of what you‚Äôre smoking"
6-Jul,Khosroparviz,"Your analysis is excellent, and I always follow you. But the interesting thing is that we have a strong cloud support at 42000 based on Residual Ichimoku Cloud method in the daily time frame, which will definitely turn into the strongest uptrend support after hitting it, which is around $71,000. Secondly, the weekly trend line passes around 42000, and it seems to me that this point will be the best point for a reversal, almost around the 50% Fibonacci level and not 61.8, which can be considered as a reversal point right from there. Of course, I have benefited from the Residual Ichimoku Cloud method from weekly to 15min timeframes and seen its accuracy. But I don't know how accurate your Elliott Wave analysis compares to my method, which your method is likely more engineering-oriented. Goodluck."
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"Questions and Answers:1)Question: According to many YouTubers, Bitcoin is people's money and is supposed to take away power from banks and potentially end the era of central banks and their money printing. Answer:This is incorrect. Bitcoin has full support from banks. In 2024, a lot of Bitcoin ETFs were launched. One of them is the ETF from BlackRock. With their power, they can make a 51% attack on Bitcoin and get rid of it."
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"2)Question: The conspiracists shockingly believe that bitcoin is part of a ‚Äúfinal beast system,‚Äù which is taking over the world through hard infrastructure.  Answer: Bitcoin is the next money into a purely cashless, digital form. Combined with biometrics, it creates the necessary technological infrastructure for a one world cashless ID, otherwise known as the mark of the beast, which AI will use for complete economic surveillance and control over the human race. 1 wallet per 1 person, monitored 24/7, limited spending power and suspended anytime by government. Is that what you want?"
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"3)Question: Would crypto currencies like bitcoin or ethereum be part of the AI future? Answer: Yes, smart contracts and blockchain have a great use case in AI."
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"4)Question: Did the CIA or NSA create Bitcoin? Answer: Yes. Bitcoin was created by a shadow government. One of the reasons is to eliminate cash on the planet. The banking system is in trouble because people are starting to wake up (not fast enough, though) to the fact that it is all funny money. So they developed Bitcoin, which sounds just great and pulls in all the people who are waking up. We all know that the shadow government has technology that is not available to the public. Some people say they may be 50 or 100 years ahead, and they already used AI systems decades ago before they released them to the public."
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"5)Question: What AI technology we use today? Answer: This AI technology is not new. It's not created by humans. It's part of a huge Galactic AI system that is in existence for a very long time, more than you can imagine. This technology was bringed to this planet by unspecified entitites."
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"6)Question: What is required for AI to run? Answer: It required electricity, microchips, computers, internet. The whole infrastructure that was build on Earth in past 100 years was one of the reasons to implement AI."
4-Jul,AlanSantana,"7)Question: How may future look with AI? Answer: Elon Musk already developing Neuralink, which is an interface to connect your brain into an AI cloud system. That means your thoughts that you have will not be yours, but will come from the AI systems. AI will tell you what you will eat, what sport you will play or what you will do during the day. This is of course part of the transformation process from organic human to a cyborg. We all know that modern technology such as wifi, bluetooth or electronic devices are not healthy and causing anxiety and depression. Human body is entirely not compatible with this technology. It breaks the highest natural law of life. Anyone who consciously support this is basically jumping into a boiling water."
28-Aug,Ether2020,"Before diving into the 2025 prediction, it's worth considering some of the key patterns we're seeing, like the Cup and Handle, Head and Shoulders, and expanding bull flags. These patterns often indicate bullish potential, which could suggest upward movement rather than a drop. These patterns are big, so it will have also a big impact. Now, regarding 2025 and the idea of a bloodbath, I'm curious why you think that might happen. There are several important factors that might suggest otherwise. For one, the Bitcoin halving already happened in April, and we’re likely to see the effects of that soon. Historically, halvings have led to significant price increases. Plus, the limited number of Bitcoins left to mine acts as a catalyst, potentially driving prices up even further."
28-Aug,Ether2020,"thanks for the idea! Looks like BTC broke the bearish rising wedge, so we might see a retest of the trend line or head towards the target. The main targets for BTC on the weekly are still holding strong, and I’m expecting it to start lifting after September.   The more sideways action we see, the stronger the breakout could be, and I think shorters might face a short squeeze in the coming weeks. That’s why, in my opinion, staying in a stablecoin is a better move than shorting right now."
28-Aug,MyCryptoParadise_Simon,your analysis really captures the tug of war between buyers and sellers around these key levels btc has certainly been in a rollercoaster mode with the initial upward momentum last week giving bulls a brief sense of control before the bears started to tighten their grip especially as we saw btc dip below the 200-day and 50-day SMAs. with the current bearish sentiment it looks like the sellers have managed to create a bit of a ceiling around the 64000 level for now and as you mentioned september is traditionally a challenging month for btc historically so that could play into further downside pressure if sellers keep the upper hand a drop to the 58000 support level could certainly be in play
28-Aug,MyCryptoParadise_Simon,"interesting to see the price action around that 59000 level after the more than 6 percent drop the recent dip definitely shook things up but as you said there might be a brighter outlook ahead with bullish market conditions potentially forming in the next 24 hours. I like the tactical idea from 10xResearch entering around 59000 with a tight stop at 58000 does seem like a prudent move especially in a market that is still lacking a clear bullish trend catching a tactical rally is often about timing and precision and this setup could offer a decent risk reward opportunity for those looking to capitalize on any short term rebound, it is also fascinating to see the continued growth in the number of bitcoin millionaires and those few holding over a billion dollars despite the market's volatility it just goes to show how much capital continues to flow into the crypto space even when conditions are not always ideal a bit of sun shining on bitcoin always tends to attract more eyes"
29-Aug,Crypto-rookie,"Thanks, this is proper analysis. Unlike all those people calling for/predicting crashes before any breakdown confirmation. People tend to forget what happened in every cycle and just focus on price action of last few weeks."
28-Aug,Elesian,"Monthly chart looks great, we consistently held above the close of the monthly bars at the peak of the 2021. There's massive bull support to hold this floor. Not sure what chart you're looking at!"
24-Aug,MyCryptoParadise_Simon,Interesting observation on the convergence of multiple technical patterns all pointing to the same target area the descending broadening wedge cup and handle and the additional broadening formation definitely add weight to a bullish outlook on Bitcoin
26-Aug,SwallowPremium,"Bitcoin is currently in a bullish uptrend based on the confluence of technical patterns. However, it's important to watch for a breakdown below the 64,113.3 support level to confirm a reversal."
