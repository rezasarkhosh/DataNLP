Xanrox;27-Jun;Is the bullish cycle really over? Definitely yes, and in this analysis, I will tell you why! The crypto market is dying in front of our eyes, if you are a hodler of many coins, you can see it very clearly on your account balance. Bitcoin failed to sustain the key level of 62k (0.618 FIB), which is an extremely strong sign of weakness. If you take a look at my Elliott Wave count, you see that the major impulse wave (12345) is complete. This is an impulse wave from the start of the bull market (15476) to the end of the bull market (73777). Take a look at wave (2) and wave (4), they both have a 21.35% pullback, so this Elliott Wave count perfectly matches.

The next reason is the rectangular range at the top of the uptrend. The range is clearly breaking down, which is another sign of weakness. What's more, we have an upward-sloping trendline that is breaking down as well. Currently, there is nothing bullish on this chart. Statistically, what is a classic correction for Bitcoin during major bear markets? 90%, 84%, or 77%. On the chart, I highlighted the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement for a 54% correction. But will this Fibonacci level really hold? Maybe temporary, but at the end, the price will go below it sooner or later.

What we can also consider is the 20 weekly moving average. Bitcoin is currently below it, and we didn't even see any reaction whatsoever.
What to do now? Should you sell your Bitcoin? My arguments are really strong, and I don't even want to know what is going to happen with altcoins. Will altcoins become dust? I am bearish.

Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades.
54% crash is nothing. We haven't had a significant crash since the start of the bull run in November 2022.""

Xanrox;28-Jun;"Always follow my latest updates and ideas. As a trader, you have to have a strong ability to change your bias and flip your outlook as soon as possible.
The majority in the comment section is very bullish. Now, do you want to be a contrarian or go with the crowd?"
Xanrox;29-Jun;I hope you are prepared for what is coming. I see a big crash on altcoins (50% - 80%) as well.
Xanrox;5-Jul;The big crash had clearly started. A lot of people are in disbelief, but the good news is that we will not go down in a straight line. The market always moves in waves, and we have significant levels on the way down. If you are still holding Bitcoin/altcoins, now you see your account balance is decreasing, so make sure you sell during the next corrective wave to the upside!
Xanrox;7-Jul;Bitcoin continues to be very weak compared to other markets. It looks like the crypto hype is completely over. Is Bitcoin still a good investment?
AlanSantana;3-Jul;Bitcoin is likely to continue straight down...  This is another instance were no significant recovery is taking place.  The lack of volume on the bounce indicates that the bulls are not ready to play.  The way market psychology works is quite intriguing... We can guess how the market will behave by considering market psychology.  What are most people expecting?  What is the feeling/market sentiment right now? Are people in fear and panic?  Are people in greed?  Tops tend to be accompanied by euphoria, excitement and greed.  Market bottoms tend to be accompanied by extreme fear and panic.  While Bitcoin produced a small drop, there is no fear, no surprise nothing. 
AlanSantana;3-Jul;"People are doing fine and this is good... It is good that people are healthy and strong. But, for us market analysts, this reveals that the correction might not be over after all. There are tens of thousands of new participants... No! Hundreds of thousands! Nay! Millions. Millions of people joined the Cryptocurrency market, bought Bitcoin, in the past 18 months.  These people had a nice ride and experienced a new all-time high but they have not experienced the other side. ust as we all went through a crash after seeing massive growth and expecting forever more when we started to trade, something similar tends to happen to every new ""generation"" of traders/participants Ñthat is what is most likely to happen next."
AlanSantana;3-Jul;"I am not calling for pain;  I am not calling for new lows...  I am not hoping that people will suffer and lose money; No!  This is a warning because I've been through the rollercoaster of down, back down then up.  I've been hoping and wishing and desiring with anxiety, my hair falling down; always positive but look at the price... Bitcoin was trading at 74,000 in March and now the price is 58,000... It is going down not up. Seeing how most people continue bullish after four months of down, no growth; reminds me of those times when people were yelling at us trying to warn us and we continued to expect growth."
AlanSantana;3-Jul;"Yes, Bitcoin will grow but only after we experience this corrections bottom low. We will know when the low is in because there will be fear and massive panic all across. 
People will be talking about quitting Crypto, selling all Bitcoin and never looking back... That will be the perfect time to look for a great entry; The time to buy. When everything becomes super-negative, in just a matter of weeks, or maybe days... That's the signal that a reversal is on its way.  When the market sentiment is full confidence even though we are having red for four months; it means that the worst part is yet to come. Thank you for reading.

FieryTrading;7-Jul;Bitcoin has been falling off hard over the last couple of days. While we're currently trading almost 10% above the 53.4k lows, the downtrend has been established and BTC bulls are losing the fight in the short-term. In my view, BTC has confirmed a longer-term downtrend by making a lower-low (56.7k was the previous low, blue line) and by falling through the 200-day SMA.
FieryTrading;7-Jul;Yes, I can see us bounce a bit further because of indicators being very oversold, but I'm not expecting a new all-time high anytime soon.  My current most likely scenario is a move towards the dotted purple support over the next 2-3 months and a bullish reversal in Q4. How do you seen BTC perform? Share your thoughts.
FirstNameHelen;10-Jul;Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. A not long time ago price declined to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, and some time traded inside, after which rebounded up to 63900 points. After this movement, the price turned around and started to decline inside the downward pennant, where it soon broke the resistance level and fell firstly to the support level, which coincided with the support zone. Soon, BTC broke the 55400 level and fell to the trend line, but then it at once rebounded and rose back, making a fake breakout of a support level. Then price rose a little more and made a correction to the support zone. After this movement, BTC rebounded and rose to the resistance line of the pennant and recently exited from this pattern. Also, it made a retest and now I expect that BTCUSDT will make a small movement down and then start to grow to the resistance level. That's why I set my goal at the 60700 level.
CharlesBroo;11-Jul;As Charles mentioned in last week's analysis, BTCUSDT is currently in a corrective recovery phase, receiving support at $54,000. However, overcoming the $60,000 resistance seems challenging and remains the target. Currently, BTCUSDT is trading stably around 58,244 USD and there are no signs of a reversal trend for this pair. Given the current trend, an upside is possible, but it may not last long as it approaches resistance. Because the chart has gradually formed a price flag pattern that shows that once it hits the resistance level, it will continue to move downward, as shown on the chart. Charles still maintains strong belief in the downtrend next week. Once the current support level is broken, there will be nothing to stop BTC from falling further. What are your thoughts on this perspective?
Finn_Oakes;11-Jul;Hello passionate traders, do you think we should buy or sell BTCUSDT today? Let's dive in together!  Currently, BTCUSDT is trading within an upward correction, moving inside a parallel channel targeting the 60,000 USD mark. My plan is to buy once it touches the lower boundary of the channel again.  That's my short-term buying strategy for this article. What are your thoughts on BTCUSDT? Leave a comment so we can discuss it together!  Wishing you happy and profitable trading!
LegionQ8;10-Jul;Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Looking at the chart, we can see how the price some time traded in the seller zone and then broke the 63800 level, after which fell to the current resistance level. After this, the price started to trades inside the range, where it rebounded from the 59100 level and in a short time rose to the 63800 level, but then it turned around and started to decline. The price quickly fell to the current resistance level, broke it, thereby exiting from the range also, and continued to fall. When BTC declined to 53500 points, it turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, where it in a short time rose to the resistance line of the channel. After this movement, the price rebounded and made a correction to the support line, after which BTC bounced and recently rose almost to the resistance area, which coincided with the current resistance level. In my opinion, the price can reach the resistance area, after which Bitcoin will turn around and start to decline to support line of the channel. For this case, I set my TP at 54750 points, which coincided with this line.
Luca_vip;9-Jul;Regarding news: The cryptocurrency market is heavily influenced by the latest decision of Fed on interest rates.  According to the 1-hour chart on TradingView, BTCUSDT is in an accumulation phase and tends to move sideways, potentially continuing to fluctuate within this range before a new breakout.  BTCUSDT has created a strong support zone at around 55,000 USD and a strong resistance zone at around 57,500 USD. The RSI index is at 58.76, indicating that the market is neither overbought nor oversold and may continue to accumulate in the short term.
Luca_vip;9-Jul;In the short term, BTCUSDT may continue to fluctuate within the current range, with a slight upward trend to test the 57,500 USD resistance level. Conversely, if the price does not break through this resistance level, it is likely to see a downward adjustment to the 55,000 USD support level before continuing the accumulation or rising trend.
weslad;9-Jul;Bitcoin recently approached the anticipated 50k level, nearly fulfilling our previous projection. However, increased selling pressure suggests a potential further decline. The 50k zone now serves as a crucial internal demand area, and its reaction will be pivotal for short-term price direction.  Should the 50k support fail, we've identified a strong external demand area on the chart that's expected to halt any deeper retracement. This zone provides a robust foundation for potential accumulation and trend reversal.  On the upside, an immediate resistance level has been identified as a potential sell-off point. We should monitor this level for possible profit-taking or short entry opportunities.
weslad;9-Jul;The current price action indicates a continued bearish bias in the short term, but the identified support levels offer potential for a bullish reversal. We should closely watch for signs of buying pressure or bullish divergences at these key levels.  Overall, Bitcoin's price movement remains within the anticipated range, with critical support and resistance levels clearly defined.  Risk management is crucial given the current market volatility.
Finn_Oakes;10-Jul;"Hello everyone, what do you think about BTCUSDT? From the chart, it's evident that BTCUSDT remains in a downtrend, characterized by significant selling volume shown by the long red bars and a well-maintained descending trendline. Currently, the price is holding at $57,403.99 with a daily adjustment of over 1%. However, the recovery remains limited by two major resistance levels clearly marked on the chart.
From my perspective, I still favor the strategy of selling in line with the main trend. Pay attention to the marked levels to find suitable trading points, and don't forget to set your take profit (TP) and stop loss (SL) orders to ensure safety."
Cryptorphic;4-Jul;Welcome to this Idea on Bitcoin.  As speculated in my previous update, the price was unable to break the 100 EMA, resulting in a rejection and subsequent decline. Now, $56,452 appears to be the next significant level to monitor. The 200 SMA on the daily chart is also crucial, with the price currently trading around this level. Let's observe if this support holds.  It's important that funds currently in meme coins shift to stronger assets, as they are siphoning liquidity from the market.  Patience is key here. I've posted over 30 altcoin charts in the last 8 days, and prices are gradually moving towards accumulation levels. If this cycle mirrors previous ones, the current market depression will soon end. We just need to stay vigilant and look for opportunities.
ArmanShabanTrading;8-Jul;By analyzing the #Bitcoin chart on the weekly timeframe, we observe that after 2 months, this cryptocurrency finally experienced a drop to fill its old FVG. Interestingly, after this FVG was filled, the price managed to rise by 10%, from $53,500 to $58,300! Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $57,200, and if it can hold above the support level of $50,500 to $53,500, we can expect further growth in the price. Other assumptions from the previous analysis remain valid.
ArmanShabanTrading;10-Jul;By Analyzing the #Bitcoin chart on the weekly time frame, we observe that the price has maintained its support level and is currently trading around $58,000. Yesterday, Bitcoin managed to rise to $59,500. Let's see if the price can successfully push above $60,000 again this week or not. Holding above $60,000 is crucial as it can serve as a significant resistance level for Bitcoin. This analysis will be updated soon!

CharlesBroo;12-Jul;Hello dear traders! Please consider the 4-hour chart, BTC is in a downtrend after breaking out of the sideway zone (in the yellow box). This is confirmed by the fact that the new highs and lows are lower than the old highs and lows. Short-term Resistance and Support Levels to consider:  Resistance: Price range around 65,000 USD (Fibonacci level 0.5) and 63,602 USD (Fibonacci level 0.618).  Support: Price range around 58,416 USD (Fibonacci level 1.0) and 50,027 USDT (Fibonacci level 1.618).
CharlesBroo;12-Jul;"Technical indicators: EMA34 (blue): Currently BTC price is below EMA34, showing strong selling pressure. 
EMA89 (red): BTC price is also below EMA89, confirming the downtrend.  Conclusion: Resistance and support levels along with exponential and Fibonacci moving averages all confirm this bearish trend Personally, in my opinion, there is a possibility that BTCUSDT could rebound slightly to the resistance area around 58,416 USD once again and retest the 34.89 EMA levels before continuing to decline. If the price breaks the current support, it could continue to decline towards deeper support around $50,027."
TezosNetwork;11-Jul;"Why? Well there's a simple answer, Bitcoin does not do what you expect. No cycle is the same, the popular sentiment is always in the wrong. For instance, in the previous cycle when Bitcoin bounced from 3-4k all the way to 13k, the entire market was hinged on the idea that the uptrend was in full swing, and that every consolidation is a buy and we were printing a bull-flag. Little did they expect, Covid dropped the price right back to the 4k region, though even without Covid that was still in the cards, because Bitcoin does not behave.  So here's the idea, this is the first cycle where the market sentiment is that pre-halving is accumulation, and post-halving is when everything goes parabolic. But what if I told you that the parabolic phase would happen in the next few months leading up to the halving, and that the halving would result in a year long consolidation to the downside bleeding out all the money that was thrown into the expectations of a ""bull run""?"
TezosNetwork;28-Feb;Just a heads up, we're close to the TOP now, I'm expecting a lot of volatile up and downs for a bit, but we'll most likely see the price hover around 55-70k for the next few weeks, consolidating sideways with a few abrupt wicks (down/up). This is NOT the time to buy btw, it's the time to SELL for your 2x profits, but keep a 20% position size just incase, you never know if you can get a sell at the premium of 72k hahah
TezosNetwork;3-May;Market is creeping up, remember folks, look at my yellow line and use that as a guide. New week just started and we're slowly crawling upwards, what does that mean? It means we're in for mid-week reversal around the highs, once we reach around 70-72k the market will dump like no tomorrow, you won't even have a chance to sell if you wanted to. Just a fair warning, Euphoria is in full swing atm. Just an update, my prior thesis is that we top out around 72k and then range between 55-70k, but the price has been hovering in the higher range between 64-72k instead, which is generally a sign of strength. If we continue to stay in the area of 70k, then it's possible we may see a breakout upwards to make a new ATH... but I wouldn't hold my hands up yet, because it's also very possible we get a pump up just to get rejected and drop right below 70k again. So what's the plan? Simple, just wait it out, because the move from 35k to 72k was already a good trade, and it's better to sit on profits than to throw it all back. I'd say it's safe to maybe sit on like a 20% position size, and then just waiting out the rest of this month to see what happens, because I'm not feeling a BTC move tbh, but if we're still here in may, then we may see something happen.
TezosNetwork;12-Jun;Hello folks, it's time for a new update, but this time, I'm brining in some macro analysis and a deep dive into the structure of Bitcoin.  Remember when I said nothing will happen until Summer/Mid-summer? Well, looks like that came to be true, Bitcoin did absolutely nothing and Altcoins bled for days.  Here's the thing, after observing Bitcoin's movements the past few months, I'm beginning to notice a few intricate details. Firstly, I'm changing my idea of the post-summer capitulation, into a possible post-summer rally! Why? Because of a few things, Alts have been bleeding and we did not have a considerable Alt season, Bitcoin is holding higher levels than expected, and lastly the consolidation has been long and uneventful (usually a bullish sign).  So what do I think will happen now? Simple, Bitcoin will consolidate sideways for a bit, and we see some Alts rally first (particularly the older Alts), and then after that, we may see Bitcoin breakout upwards around the end of summer, and around the end of this year we'll get the biggest moves to the upside from retail. That's about it.
Xanrox;26-Aug;"Everyone is turning very bullish, which is not good for the crypto market. With the upcoming bloody September, we have a strong confluence to sell Bitcoin with the current price of 63,800. Why are Bitcoin and whole crypto in a bear market? On the chart, we can see that the price is printing lower lows and lower highs, which is by definition a downtrend. It has been like this since March 2024, and nothing has changed since then. We can see that the price is inside this descending parallel channel on the daily chart. There are no signs of strength in higher timeframes! Bulls didn't prove their strength yet, so to me it looks like a bull trap, and we will see a 30% crash! From the Elliott Wave perspective, we have an ABC correction so far, and it's too early to tell if this will turn into an impulse wave or not, but right now this is a corrective structure. The problem is that everyone is turning bullish again; everyone sees a huge bull market, but usually the market does the opposite. Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades."
Xanrox;27-Aug;"Ethereum shows major weakness for the whole crypto market and altcoins. We can clearly see a descending triangle, and the price is below its resistance. This is not bullish. Bitcoin is approaching the main trendline of this uptrend. We also have a FVG (Fair Value GAP), but to me, this gap looks like an exhaustion gap, not a breakaway gap. This is very bearish.
Xanrox;28-Aug;The crash is very strong, and September didn't even start (we will see more downside later).
Xanrox;29-Aug;A lot of people got liquidated during this dump, but we will see more liquidation soon! I don't want to even see altcoins. I was really confident about this crash, as every time I see moonboys in the comment section, I need to enter a short position. Monthly candles: On Bitcoin, we have the lowest close since February! This is bearish.
EXCAVO;29-Aug;After the last fall, you entered the zone of interest. Now, we are likely to go to the white box, from which we will see the final movement down and the subsequent impulse with the renewal of new tops or without dipping into the zone of 54-56k. I look at the market extremely positively. -Because everything is down right now - Altcoins -We've held the Bitcoin level. -In a few days, it's September. -Markets rise on fear.
TradingShot;28-Aug;Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is taking a hit on a weekly basis as, despite last week's green candle that extended the rebound on the 1W MA50 (blue trend-line) and hyped hopes for a new 70k test, the last two days are resetting the momentum. Still, there is no cause for alarm as BTC has been practically consolidating since the March All Time High (ATH). And in fact, the market is no stranger to such consolidations as just as recently as last year, it was also ranged from March until October 2023, before starting the massive rally that led to the ATH. Even in the previous Cycle, we can somewhat see a rough consolidation pattern, which if it weren't for the COVID crash 'anomaly' of February 2020, the market would again be ranged from March to October 2020. As a side-note, check also how similar the 1W RSI sequences of those fractals are, trading around the same price levels as well. For title catchers, we can call this 'The March - October effect' and if it plays out again the exact same way it has historically, then as soon as September ends, we can be expecting one of Bitcoin's brutal Bull Cycle rallies (green Channels). Practically we are only a month away and as you can see in the previous Bull Cycle, the main two rallies have been fairly symmetric. If the one that might start in October is proportionally as strong as the October 2023 - February 2024 one, we might be looking for at least a $150000 Target.
Prefabsprout;27-Aug;If it weren't for the deadly bearish monthly chart this would look like too obvious a short set up. Curious to see if they drag it up to the top of the pennant again, or if it breaks down from here…
Prefabsprout;29-Aug;an inside bar would more likely mean a retest of the top of the pennant in my mind. so further slippage below 58 this week is called for if we want to maintain a bearish narrative. very curious to see how this plays out going into the new month.
The_ForexX_Mindset;28-Aug;Spent 7-plus hours connecting a strategy from a 5 candlestick countdown from a false breakout rocket signal. This means after a total of 5 candlesticks, BULLISH MOMENTUM begins. We might have our next 4-day timeframe 5 candlesticks as a downtrend, if so, then BULL RUN reads to start on 9/13 after a downtrend up to $56,761 or remain within its price range. Don't let this price scare you. It's only an estimate. Who am I to predict $56,761? but be ready to accept whatever comes our way within this current 4D TF candle and the other two candlesticks which will print out after this current candle. 5 candlesticks downtrend has been rejected in the past, if so, then BULL RUN is to start at any moment from 8/28/24 moving forward. This strategy requires waiting for confirmation. This strategy requires waiting for confirmation. Some of you would not have to wait for confirmation because you entered at the entry signal of 49K. Histogram trendlines are to confirm BULL CONFIRMATIONS but trendlines can be best used never alone but with my 5 candlestick countdown signal. I can't explain it all but I made it look easy to understand without reading. The picture chart says it all.This strategy is new to me. I had to get creative. I marked it as short but in reality, it's long.
The_ForexX_Mindset;29-Aug;We’ve waited long enough. This false breakout to the downside is to be confirmed by a total of 5 candles as a BEAR TRAP then moves up. We’ve seen how the trend moved up then the rally failed. 1. We wait for all total of 5 candles to close. 2. Or the false breakout downtrend may end within this currant candle 4D TF and make its way up. As I’ve been studying this FALSE breakout, I’ve seen many of these get rejected and move up. I did mention to a trader, if this was to happen then the body of the current candle must be above the body of the previous candle to then disregard the false breakout BEAR TRAP otherwise we wait. Normal in situations like this some traders sell but we’ve been confirmed something big is coming our way.
weslad;28-Aug;Bitcoin took a significant hit yesterday, dropping past our initial target zone and finding support at the secondary zone outlined in Plan B. The purpose of our plan is to identify key levels or zones that serve as strong areas for potential trades. If the Plan B level continues to hold, the price may form a potential leading diagonal, creating a wave structure from 1-5 as highlighted on the chart. This scenario could push BTC's next target back to the 66k-68k range. This setup allows us to use a tight stop loss just below 56k. It's a volatile market, so we should be prepared for any outcome. Trade safely.
weslad;29-Aug;Price going smoothly as expected, we may have first stop at 62k area, we should keep a close watch on this zone.
weslad;24-Aug;Hello everyone, This post highlights a series of technical patterns, all converging towards the same target area on Bitcoin. We’ve identified a descending broadening wedge, a cup and handle formation, and another descending broadening formation. The alignment of these patterns reinforces our bullish bias on Bitcoin, suggesting that a major upside move is imminent. We believe the potential for a significant rally is stronger now than ever. Please share your comments and thoughts on this analysis.
weslad;27-Aug;Price may be going down to give good buy back opportunity for those that still want to join the trade. We are anticipating the current pullback to initiate a move towards 68k/70k area before next correction. BTC is bullish and the trend is Bullish never Bearish.
AlanSantana;29-Aug;"We have two major lows to consider on this chart; STPTBTC. The first one happened September 2019 at 72 sats (0.00000072). Immediately after this low was hit, a bullish wave develop and totaled 789% growth. Nice, The second one is the ATL (All-Time Low), happened January 2021 at 41 sats (0.00000041). Immediately after this low was hit, a bullish wave developed and totaled 1,318% growth. Great! Now, we have a new major low and this is a long-term higher low, this happened June 2024 at 55 sats (0.00000055). We have two months of consolidation and there is potential for a new bullish wave. Total growth potential can hit between 557% and 933%. It can go higher as well but this is something that we have to wait to see how it all develops."
AlanSantana;28-Aug;My dear friends, I think you will like this one. I like this pair because we have been successful with it in the past and the chart looks good. There is one signal that is most important above all. We know the Crypto-market has been bearish, for a while now, and many altcoins have been hitting new lows all across. SafePal, on its Bitcoin pairing, SFPBTC, hit bottom March 2024... That's the signal. While there was a crash in early August, while there have seen swings, shakeouts and all that, this pair has been consolidating steadily, bullishly and this type of bullish consolidation tends to lead to massive growth.
Richtv_official;28-Aug;Recent Market Activity: Last night, Bitcoin experienced a sell-off, dropping to the next support level after attempting to reclaim both the Daily 200 Moving Average (MA) and the $64,000 resistance level at the end of last week. Key Levels: Daily 200 MA: A reclaim of this level would have been very bullish, but the drop below it in the last two days indicates that the bulls are not ready to push higher. Resistance at $64,000: BTC’s failure to reclaim this level signals continued weakness. Bearish Signals: With this being the second lower high on the Daily time frame since June, Bitcoin is clearly indicating that it is not yet ready to move higher.
paul_endeo;28-Aug;BTC had been in an upward trajectory as the previous week drew to a close, rising by 3.50% on Wednesday before a slight drop on Thursday as the 50-day SMA came into play, allowing sellers to push BTC down by just over 1%. However, bulls took control on Friday, with BTC registering an increase of 5.97%, pushing above the 50- and 200-day SMAs to settle at $64,032. In fact, BTC reached a day high of $65,054, but sellers pushed the price back below $65,000, a level they were expected to defend vigorously. The weekend saw buyers and sellers struggle to take control, with BTC only managing a marginal increase on Saturday. Sunday saw buyers attempt another push towards $65,000 while sellers tried to drive the price below the 200-day SMA. However, neither could establish control, and BTC remained at $64,085. The current week began with BTC dipping below the 200-day SMA after a 1.85% drop as sellers tightened their grip on the market. As a result, BTC dropped to $62,903. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as markets crashed, with BTC dropping by 5.40% to slip below the 50 and 20-day SMAs and the $60,000 price level to $59,506. The current session sees BTC remain in the red, down by 0.50%, as sellers look to drive the price lower. With Tuesday’s reversal, sellers have established control in the market, with any move above $64,000 ruled out for the time being. With September historically being a difficult month for BTC, it could drop further should sellers remain in control. Buyers will attempt to regroup and reclaim the $60,000 level, which is crucial to resume a push back above the moving averages and move towards $64,000. Should sellers continue to dominate, BTC could drop to the $58,000 support level.
Lingrid;29-Aug;Ethereum is clearly in the accumulation phase, sitting just below the psychological level of 3000. Recently, the price hit a support level that was also tested back in February and subsequently bounced off it. Over the past three weeks, we've observed mostly sideways movement. When examining the weekly timeframe, it's evident that the market formed a long-tailed bar, indicating a liquidity grab below the February low. This suggests that there was strong buying interest after the dip. Given that the market has retested the recent low area and rebounded, I believe we can expect a gradual upward movement from here. My target is resistance zone around 2950.
