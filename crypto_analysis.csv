Xanrox,June 27,"Is the bullish cycle really over? Definitely yes, and in this analysis, I will tell you why! The crypto market is dying in front of our eyes, if you are a hodler of many coins, you can see it very clearly on your account balance. Bitcoin failed to sustain the key level of 62k (0.618 FIB), which is an extremely strong sign of weakness. If you take a look at my Elliott Wave count, you see that the major impulse wave (12345) is complete. This is an impulse wave from the start of the bull market (15476) to the end of the bull market (73777). Take a look at wave (2) and wave (4), they both have a 21.35% pullback, so this Elliott Wave count perfectly matches.

The next reason is the rectangular range at the top of the uptrend. The range is clearly breaking down, which is another sign of weakness. What's more, we have an upward-sloping trendline that is breaking down as well. Currently, there is nothing bullish on this chart. Statistically, what is a classic correction for Bitcoin during major bear markets? 90%, 84%, or 77%. On the chart, I highlighted the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement for a 54% correction. But will this Fibonacci level really hold? Maybe temporary, but at the end, the price will go below it sooner or later.

What we can also consider is the 20 weekly moving average. Bitcoin is currently below it, and we didn't even see any reaction whatsoever.

What to do now? Should you sell your Bitcoin? My arguments are really strong, and I don't even want to know what is going to happen with altcoins. Will altcoins become dust? I am bearish.

Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades.
54% crash is nothing. We haven't had a significant crash since the start of the bull run in November 2022."
Xanrox,June 28,"Always follow my latest updates and ideas. As a trader, you have to have a strong ability to change your bias and flip your outlook as soon as possible.
The majority in the comment section is very bullish. Now, do you want to be a contrarian or go with the crowd?"
Xanrox,June 29,I hope you are prepared for what is coming. I see a big crash on altcoins (50% - 80%) as well.
Xanrox,July 5,"The big crash had clearly started. A lot of people are in disbelief, but the good news is that we will not go down in a straight line. The market always moves in waves, and we have significant levels on the way down. If you are still holding Bitcoin/altcoins, now you see your account balance is decreasing, so make sure you sell during the next corrective wave to the upside!"
Xanrox,Last update,Bitcoin continues to be very weak compared to other markets. It looks like the crypto hype is completely over. Is Bitcoin still a good investment?
AlanSantana,July 3,A major bearish signal (BD-Signal) is now in the making when looking at Bitcoin through the weekly timeframe chart... Let's jump in!
But first, how are you doing?
I hope this day and week fills you with joy, growth, knowledge and all the pleasures life has to offer... I hope your journey toward enlightenment continues to improve.
If you are not in a journey toward enlightenment, then you should consider it.
Ok... Let's look at the chart.
Bitcoin is moving weekly below the mid-pace exponential-moving average of twenty one periods. The last time this happened was November 2021, after a major all-time high in prices.
This is the first time this events happens in almost three years; Bitcoin moving below this major ma coming from a new ATH.
What does this means? This means that a major crash is ahead of us... By "ahead of us" I mean soon, really, really soon... The biggest crash since 2021. It will be fast and strong.
AlanSantana,July 4,Based on the weekly timeframe, it is still early but we have full confirmation of the move we've been tracking for the past few months.
For this analysis, EMA21 weekly is the relevant signal/indicator.
The week still has 3.5 more days to go before closing thus plenty of time.
A close below 61,300 confirms the major bearish signal, so it is possible that the biggest crash will actually develop.
AlanSantana,July 5, The above mentioned bearish signal confirmation is not yet in but basically confirmed. A confirm break of EMA21 as support would lead to a minimum price of around $48,400. Since $48,400 is a very week level; Bitcoin didn't trade here for more than a few days, we can expect to see the next main and major level to be tested at the least. This major level sits at $42,855.
The bigger portion of the bearish move is yet to materialize.
The altcoins will bottom before Bitcoin but these too will continue to suffer for a while.

The ALTSBTC can look good and safe as predicted long-term.
Questions and Answers:
1)Question: According to many YouTubers, Bitcoin is people's money and is supposed to take away power from banks and potentially end the era of central banks and their money printing.
Answer: This is incorrect. Bitcoin has full support from banks. In 2024, a lot of Bitcoin ETFs were launched. One of them is the ETF from BlackRock. With their power, they can make a 51% attack on Bitcoin and get rid of it.
2)Question: The conspiracists shockingly believe that bitcoin is part of a “final beast system,” which is taking over the world through hard infrastructure. 
Answer: Bitcoin is the next money into a purely cashless, digital form. Combined with biometrics, it creates the necessary technological infrastructure for a one world cashless ID, otherwise known as the mark of the beast, which AI will use for complete economic surveillance and control over the human race. 1 wallet per 1 person, monitored 24/7, limited spending power and suspended anytime by government. Is that what you want?
3)Question: Would crypto currencies like bitcoin or ethereum be part of the AI future?
Answer: Yes, smart contracts and blockchain have a great use case in AI.
4)Question: Did the CIA or NSA create Bitcoin?
Answer: Yes. Bitcoin was created by a shadow government. One of the reasons is to eliminate cash on the planet. The banking system is in trouble because people are starting to wake up (not fast enough, though) to the fact that it is all funny money. So they developed Bitcoin, which sounds just great and pulls in all the people who are waking up.
We all know that the shadow government has technology that is not available to the public. Some people say they may be 50 or 100 years ahead, and they already used AI systems decades ago before they released them to the public.
5)Question: What AI technology we use today?
Answer: This AI technology is not new. It's not created by humans. It's part of a huge Galactic AI system that is in existence for a very long time, more than you can imagine. This technology was bringed to this planet by unspecified entitites.
6)Question: What is required for AI to run?
Answer: It required electricity, microchips, computers, internet. The whole infrastructure that was build on Earth in past 100 years was one of the reasons to implement AI.
7)Question: How may future look with AI?
Answer: Elon Musk already developing Neuralink, which is an interface to connect your brain into an AI cloud system. That means your thoughts that you have will not be yours, but will come from the AI systems. AI will tell you what you will eat, what sport you will play or what you will do during the day. This is of course part of the transformation process from organic human to a cyborg. We all know that modern technology such as wifi, bluetooth or electronic devices are not healthy and causing anxiety and depression. Human body is entirely not compatible with this technology. It breaks the highest natural law of life. Anyone who consciously support this is basically jumping into a boiling water.
