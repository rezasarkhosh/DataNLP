Xanrox,27-Jun,"Is the bullish cycle really over? Definitely yes, and in this analysis, I will tell you why! The crypto market is dying in front of our eyes, if you are a hodler of many coins, you can see it very clearly on your account balance. Bitcoin failed to sustain the key level of 62k (0.618 FIB), which is an extremely strong sign of weakness. If you take a look at my Elliott Wave count, you see that the major impulse wave (12345) is complete. This is an impulse wave from the start of the bull market (15476) to the end of the bull market (73777). Take a look at wave (2) and wave (4), they both have a 21.35% pullback, so this Elliott Wave count perfectly matches.

The next reason is the rectangular range at the top of the uptrend. The range is clearly breaking down, which is another sign of weakness. What's more, we have an upward-sloping trendline that is breaking down as well. Currently, there is nothing bullish on this chart. Statistically, what is a classic correction for Bitcoin during major bear markets? 90%, 84%, or 77%. On the chart, I highlighted the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement for a 54% correction. But will this Fibonacci level really hold? Maybe temporary, but at the end, the price will go below it sooner or later.

What we can also consider is the 20 weekly moving average. Bitcoin is currently below it, and we didn't even see any reaction whatsoever.

What to do now? Should you sell your Bitcoin? My arguments are really strong, and I don't even want to know what is going to happen with altcoins. Will altcoins become dust? I am bearish.

Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades.
54% crash is nothing. We haven't had a significant crash since the start of the bull run in November 2022."
Xanrox,28-Jun,"Always follow my latest updates and ideas. As a trader, you have to have a strong ability to change your bias and flip your outlook as soon as possible.
The majority in the comment section is very bullish. Now, do you want to be a contrarian or go with the crowd?"
Xanrox,29-Jun,I hope you are prepared for what is coming. I see a big crash on altcoins (50% - 80%) as well.
Xanrox,5-Jul,"The big crash had clearly started. A lot of people are in disbelief, but the good news is that we will not go down in a straight line. The market always moves in waves, and we have significant levels on the way down. If you are still holding Bitcoin/altcoins, now you see your account balance is decreasing, so make sure you sell during the next corrective wave to the upside!"
Xanrox,7-Jul,Bitcoin continues to be very weak compared to other markets. It looks like the crypto hype is completely over. Is Bitcoin still a good investment?
AlanSantana,3-Jul,"Bitcoin is likely to continue straight down...  This is another instance were no significant recovery is taking place.  The lack of volume on the bounce indicates that the bulls are not ready to play.  The way market psychology works is quite intriguing... We can guess how the market will behave by considering market psychology.  What are most people expecting?  What is the feeling/market sentiment right now? Are people in fear and panic?  Are people in greed?  Tops tend to be accompanied by euphoria, excitement and greed.  Market bottoms tend to be accompanied by extreme fear and panic.  While Bitcoin produced a small drop, there is no fear, no surprise—nothing. "
AlanSantana,3-Jul,"People are doing fine and this is good... It is good that people are healthy and strong. But, for us market analysts, this reveals that the correction might not be over after all. There are tens of thousands of new participants... No! Hundreds of thousands! Nay! Millions. Millions of people joined the Cryptocurrency market, bought Bitcoin, in the past 18 months.  These people had a nice ride and experienced a new all-time high but they have not experienced the other side. ust as we all went through a crash after seeing massive growth and expecting forever more when we started to trade, something similar tends to happen to every new ""generation"" of traders/participants —that is what is most likely to happen next. "
AlanSantana,3-Jul,"I am not calling for pain;  I am not calling for new lows...  I am not hoping that people will suffer and lose money; No!  This is a warning because I've been through the rollercoaster of down, back down then up.  I've been hoping and wishing and desiring with anxiety, my hair falling down; always positive but look at the price... Bitcoin was trading at 74,000 in March and now the price is 58,000... It is going down not up. Seeing how most people continue bullish after four months of down, no growth; reminds me of those times when people were yelling at us trying to warn us and we continued to expect growth. "
AlanSantana,3-Jul,"Yes, Bitcoin will grow but only after we experience this corrections bottom low. We will know when the low is in because there will be fear and massive panic all across. 
People will be talking about quitting Crypto, selling all Bitcoin and never looking back... That will be the perfect time to look for a great entry; The time to buy. When everything becomes super-negative, in just a matter of weeks, or maybe days... That's the signal that a reversal is on its way.  When the market sentiment is full confidence even though we are having red for four months; it means that the worst part is yet to come.
